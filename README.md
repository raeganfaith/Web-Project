# Web Project Overview
The  site's  name  that  we  are  planning  to  make  is  "Among  Us  for  Novice  and Experts."  We  are  creating  this  website  to  help  in  disseminating  information  like  the objectives, features, controls, maps, mods, tutorials, reviews, tips, and the tricks they can do  inside  the  game  that  will  guide  the  players  in  improving  and  promoting  better gameplay. Another purpose of the site is to promote a safer gaming environment for all the players in the Among Us.  The  goal  the  developers  want  to  implicate  in  the  web  project is  to  give  factual information  to  safely  guide  players  without  promoting  hacks  that  will  make  the  game environment unhealthy for other players. For our site to be successful, it is necessary to provide  and  promote  information  that  will  lead  to  the  banning of  the  players.  Instead, giving basic to advance up to the updated information about the game to establish better gameplay for players should be prioritized.  The site's target audience can be any gender with mobile and desktop devices as long  as  they  are players  ages  nine  years  old  and  above  interested  in  improving  their knowledge  about  Among  Us.  This  includes  novice,  experts,  and  players  interested  in playing  the game. It  also  targets  the  returning  players of  the  Among  Us  to  guide them regarding the game's latest updates.   Regarding  the  opportunity  and  issue  our  site  is  addressing,  the  site  provides information that is precise to the subtopics of each web page. This is beneficial since it avoids confusion, making each player Among Us that visits the website stay interested in the context of each web page. Lastly, we will simplify broad information to help the website visitors find what specific information will fill their curiosity
